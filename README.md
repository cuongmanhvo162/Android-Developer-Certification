# Android-Developer-Certification
This repo is aim to store all useful info for Android developer certification.
In addition, an android project to include all the necessary skills for the exam:
  
 - How to build Android UIâ€™s
 - Asynchronous data loading, and background jobs
 - Data storage
 - Debugging
 - UI Testing
 
In this project I will try to use the best clean and architectural aproaches which I have found and 
the last libraries and frameworks used in Android development:

- RxJava2
- Dagger2
...

Finally, I want that this project serve me as base for further projects.

This project is based on Ribot and Android10 architecture projects. You can find the links below in references.
